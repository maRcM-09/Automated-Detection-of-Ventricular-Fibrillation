# Automated-Detection-of-Ventricular-Fibrillation
In this project, we will be exploring various heart rhythms in terms of their fre quency content. We will devise methods, based on the frequency morphology of ECG  signals, to be used in monitoring systems for distinguishing normal and abnormal  rhythms.

# Methodology

The signal was filtered using two different techniques: IIR and FIR filters over windows of 10 seconds.

Then, when looking at the frequency content, we realized abnormal heart rhymes have a dominant frequency. Using this knowledge, an algorithm was developed to detect such abnormal heart rhymes.
The results can be found in the report in the files.
