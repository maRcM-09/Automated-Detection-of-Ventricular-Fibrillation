# Automated-Detection-of-Ventricular-Fibrillation
In this project, we will be exploring various heart rhythms in terms of their fre quency content. We will devise methods, based on the frequency morphology of ECG  signals, to be used in monitoring systems for distinguishing normal and abnormal  rhythms.
